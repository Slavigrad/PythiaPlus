# PythiaPlus

Angular 20 + Kotlin + Spring Boot 4 + Embeddings + pgvector + Local LLMs + Slavigrad design AI-powered talent search platform with semantic NLP matching. 

AI-powered talent search platform with semantic NLP matching. 

Angular 20 frontend with signal-based architecture + Kotlin Spring Boot backend using PostgreSQL pgvector for 1024-dimensional embedding search. 

Features natural language queries, real-time match scoring, and Swiss-inspired UI design.

# **Pythia – Slavigrad Talent Oracle**

*Where engineering craft meets language, meaning, and myth.*

**Pythia** is an AI-powered talent search oracle — a fusion of
**Angular 20**, **Kotlin + Spring Boot 4**, **Embeddings**, **pgvector**, **Local LLMs**, and **Slavigrad’s signature design aesthetic**.

Built as a hearth project, born from craft and conviction,
Pythia transforms raw text into structured insight,
and everyday HR queries into **semantic intelligence**.

---

## 🔮 **What Is Pythia?**

Pythia is a modern talent search platform that understands language the way humans do.
It doesn’t filter.
It **comprehends**.

Describe a candidate in natural prose — and Pythia responds like an oracle:

> *“Senior Kotlin developer in Zurich with cloud experience and B2 German.”*

Under the hood, embeddings and vector search orchestrate a silent dialogue between meaning and math.
On the screen, Slavigrad’s crystalline UI makes the insight unmistakably yours.

## ⚙️ **Technology Stack**

### **Frontend – Angular 20**

* Fully signal-based architecture
* Clean, reactive data flows
* Pythia+ inspired charts and interactions
* Slavigrad glassmorphic aurora design

### **Backend – Kotlin + Spring Boot 4**

* Modern Spring DI + coroutines-ready
* Zero-hassle domain modeling
* Clean endpoints for semantic search

### **AI Core – Embeddings + Local LLMs**

* 1024-dimensional multilingual embeddings
* Served locally via **Ollama**
* No vendor lock-in, no API cost, full control

### **Semantic Search Engine – PostgreSQL pgvector**

* High-performance cosine similarity
* Optimized indexing for real-time search
* Ranking by semantic relevance, not keyword overlap

---

## 🌌 **What It Does**

* Accepts **human language queries**
* Converts them to embeddings via local model
* Performs pgvector similarity search
* Returns ranked candidates with:

    * profile summary
    * role/title
    * availability
    * semantic match score
    * matched skills
* Visualizes talent insights through elegant charts

The goal:
**turn unstructured text into structured knowledge — instantly.**

---

## 🜁 **Why Pythia?**

Because talent search deserves more than filters.
Because HR deserves meaning, not mechanical checklists.
Because the future of engineering blends:

* logic and language
* math and metaphor
* code and intuition

Pythia embodies all of this with one sentence:

> **The Oracle of Slavigrad answers in embeddings.**
